1. What is 'plt.gcf()'?
    'gcf' stands for "get current figure". It is a function that returns a reference to the current figure in the current state of the plot. The figure is the top-level container for all the plot elements. 
    It is used to obtain a reference to the current figure, and then you can perform operations or modifications on that figure.
